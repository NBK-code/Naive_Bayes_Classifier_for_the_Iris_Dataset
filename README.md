# Naive Bayes Classifier for the Iris Dataset

In this work, we build a naive Bayes classifier for the Iris dataset. The notebook is divided into two parts:
* Naive Bayes classifier for only two features
* Naive Bayes classifier for all the features

The Iris dataset contains four features for each sample. In the first part, we use only the first two features to aid us in plotting the various distributions. In the second part we use all the features. We will see a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of the classifier when all the features are used.

Along the way, we also include neccessary mathematical background for the naive Bayes classifier.
